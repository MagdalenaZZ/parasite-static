_Gyrodactylus bullatarudis_ is a monogenean parasite of the guppy (_Poecilia reticulata_) which is a model species in eco-evolutionary research. Monogeneans are economically important fish pathogens and provide a model system for studying parasite adaptation to its host and the genetic diversity and epidemiology of parasitic infections.
