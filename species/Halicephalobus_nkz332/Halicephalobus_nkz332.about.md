_Halicephalobus_ (Panagrolaimidae) is a clade of small, parthenogenic Clade IV nematodes that have sometimes colonized remarkable habitats; from blood to microbial biofilms at depths of over three kilometers within the earthâ€™s crust. _Halicephalobus_ species provide a point of comparison for parallelisms with other parthenogenic _panagrolaimid_ species in the evolution of asexuality, and ecological niche adaptation. Given its molecular and geographic distinctness from other known _Halicephalobus_ strains, the sequenced strain (NKZ332) is presented as a new species: _Halicephalobus sp._ NKZ332, isolated from termites in Japan.
